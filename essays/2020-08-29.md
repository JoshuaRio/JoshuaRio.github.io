Hi guys! My name is Josh, and I am a sophomore planning to major in Management Information Systems (MIS) and Finance with a minor in Computer Science. I really love the idea of learning more about what I don't know. As such, the mystery of computers and how they work has always intrigued me, and I wanted to take MIS and Computer Science to understand them fully. I also want to delve deeper into website management through the use of HTML/CSS, as designing a website from the foundations of coding was something I have always wanted to do. Along with this, the skills that I ultimatelty will learn from taking this class will help towards a possible future in the IT field.

Personally, I really enjoy hanging out with friends, whether it be hiking or just having an all-night gamenight through discord!
